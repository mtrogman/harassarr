### Volumes

You will need to map the following volumes:

| Host Path              | Container Path | Reason                                                                                            |
|------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /path/to/config/folder | /config        | Required, path to the folder containing the configuration file                                    |



You can also set these variables via a configuration file:

1. Map the `/config` directory (see volumes above)
2. Enter the mapped directory on your host machine
3. Rename the ``config.yml.example`` file in the path to ``config.yml``
4. Complete the variables in ``config.yml``

### User import (CSV)
- primaryDiscord = String value, optional,  This is the discord user assoicated with the access
- primaryDiscordId = 16 Digit Discord User ID
- secondaryDiscord = String value, optional,  This is the secondary discord user assoicated with the access
- secondaryDiscordId = 16 Digit Discord User ID
- primaryEmail = String value, required,  This is the email address plex has granted access to.
- secondaryEmail = String value, optional,  This is the secondary email address associated with the access (maybe someone manages access for them)

        - Primary = only primaryDiscord user will get communicated with
        - Secondary = only secondaryDiscord user will get communicated with
        - Both = both primary and secondary discord users will get communicated with

- paymentMethod = String, optional, This is how the user paid you (examples: PayPal, Venmo, CashApp, Cash)

- endDate = Date format (MM/DD/YYYY), This is when their service ends.
- joinDate = Date format (MM/DD/YYYY), This is their first start date (keep track of how long they have been a customer).
